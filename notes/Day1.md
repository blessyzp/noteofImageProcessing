### 1. Image Classification
Classify the input image to pre-decided categories.

Usage Sences: 
- ** Image identification **
- ** Medical image analysis **
- ** Autonomous driving **

Deep Learning Models:
- AlexNet: One of the earliest deep convolutional neural networks used for image classification.
- VGG: A deeper convolutional network with strong performance but heavy computational costs.
- ResNet: Introduced the residual structure to solve the problem of gradient vanishing in deep networks.
